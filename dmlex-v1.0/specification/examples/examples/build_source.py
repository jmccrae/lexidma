## Build all the source files so they can be included in the examples
## To use this delete all files in source/ and then
## copy the basic files from jmccrae/dmlex-converter
## and run this script
## e.g.,
##     rm source/*
##     cp ~/projects/jmccrae/dmlex-converter/dmlex/examples/* source/
##     python build_source.py
