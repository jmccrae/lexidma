  <title>DMLex Linking Module</title>
  <para>DMLex's Linking Module can be used to construct <emphasis>relations</emphasis> between
    objects which "break out" of the tree-like parent-and-child hierarchy constructed from datatypes
    from the Core and from other modules. The Linking Module can be used to create relations between
    senses which are synonyms or antonyms, between entries whose headwords are homonyms or spelling
    variants, between senses which represent superordinate and subordinate concepts (eg. hypernyms
    and hyponyms, holonyms and meronyms), between entries and subentries, between senses and
    subsenses, and many others.</para>
  <para>Each relation is represented in DMLex by an instance of the <code>relation</code> datatype.
    A relation brings two or more <emphasis>members</emphasis> together. The fact that an object
    (such as a sense or an entry) is a member of a relation is represented in DMLex by an instance
    of the <code>member</code> datatype.</para>
  <para>The Linking Module can be used to set up relations between objects inside the same
    lexicographic resource, or between objects residing in different lexicographic resources.</para>
  <para>For linking, some type of reference IDs of linked objects are needed (cf. the
    <literal>ref</literal> property in <xref linkend="linking_member"/>). DMLex does not prescribe
    the exact form of these IDs, however, a recommended method for creating unique IRIs for
    DMLex objects is available in <xref linkend="frag_iri"/>, which may be useful especially
    when linking objects from different lexicographic resources on the Web.</para>
  <para>Examples: <xref linkend="ex12"/>, <xref linkend="ex13"/>, <xref linkend="ex14"/>, <xref
      linkend="ex15"/>, <xref linkend="ex16"/>, <xref linkend="ex17"/>, <xref linkend="ex18"/>. </para>
